# Longest-Word-Finder
This is just a simple code I wrote so that I could practice Python. 
Input your sentence, and the system will return the longest word of your sentence!
The code will run on a loop, so you can try as many sentences as you want. 
When you wish to quit the game, just type "exit" (case insensitive) and it will stop 😁
